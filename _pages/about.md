I am a PHD scholar at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. My area of research is mostly applied control theory. My work primarily focusses on control of unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous vision-based navigation and landing, rigid-body attitude control, robust and adaptive control. Since I joined the PhD programme right after my bachelors, I will be completing my masters this year and PhD by next year.
