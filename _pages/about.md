I am an MTech + Ph.D. student in the [Dept. of Electrical Engineering](https://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/), [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/). My favoured area of research is applied control theory. My thesis primarily focusses on control of unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous vision-based navigation and landing, rigid-body attitude control, robust and adaptive control. I have immensely enjoyed working with my thesis supervisors [Dr. Soumya Ranjan Sahoo](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~srsahoo/) and [Dr. Mangal Kothari](https://www.iitk.ac.in/aero/mangal/). Previously, I have worked extensively on electronics and instrumentation during my undergraduate studies in [SJCE, Mysore](https://sjce.ac.in/).

Currently, my interests lie in traditional helicopter control, design and control of novel VTOL UAVs, vision-based localization and landing, cooperative control and swarming, and machine learning. Working in close association with [Dr. Abhishek](http://www.iitk.ac.in/aero/abhishek/) on some of the aforementioned topics.

When I am not doing research, I play basketball or keep myself busy with Indian classical music. When I am on vacation, I mostly like to eat south Indian food, have my favourite filter coffee, and go on motorcycle rides. I am a diehard Michael Jordan fan. I have been formally learning carnatic classical music for about 20 years now. Currently, I am under the tutelage of vidwan [Kumaresh Rajagopalan, a.k.a. the Fiddling Monk](http://www.kumaresh.in/) for violin, vidwan [Somashekar Jois](https://www.worldkonnakkolacademy.com/) for konnakkol, and vidwan [Prashanth N. R.](https://www.thiraseela.com/artist/profile.php?perfmrid=629) for vocal lessons.
