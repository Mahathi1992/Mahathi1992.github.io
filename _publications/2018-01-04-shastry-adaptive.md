Quadrotors have enormous application in the area of automated delivery systems. In such scenarios, payload can vary with time, and cannot be tackled by traditional controllers. This work presents a nonlinear adaptive control design of a variable-pitch quadrotor. Sudden changes in mass and uncertainty in the rotational inertia of the quadrotor emphasizes the necessity for an adaptive control technique. Quadrotors with variable-pitch propellers are chosen as they provide higher rate of change of thrust and inverted flight capabilities. MATLAB environment is utilized to show a drone-delivery simulation along with trajectory tracking and inverted flight.
